        <h1>Nala's Game</h1>
        <p><b>></b>Nala's Game is a simple retro game for the Game Boy.</p>
        <p><b>></b>In the game, you have to catch different humans. The humans will try to run away from you, each at a
            different speed. If any human succeeds in getting to their home, you'll lose.</p>
        <p><b>></b>I developed this game in C with the gbdk-2020 sdk after seeing some of the tutorials by <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GamingMonsters" data-type="URL"
                data-id="https://www.youtube.com/c/GamingMonsters">Gaming Monsters</a>. (Which are great honestly).</p>
        <p><b>></b>I believe I have lost the source code for this game, which is quite sad as it is my first C project
            and I was very proud of it. This is what people feel after losing a child, probably.</p>
